        <p>
            The quality of education in the Italian school is clearly below the European average.
            A large number of Italian adolescents (between 15% and 25%) fail to reach the threshold of the minimum
            skills necessary to orient themselves
            in university studies or in the world of work. It is therefore necessary to guarantee a strengthening of
            basic skills and improve social inclusion,
            to combat early school leaving.

        <h4 class="text-header" id="topic-2">The history</h4>
        <p>
            In the Italian Constitution, in 1946 public education was established, free and compulsory up to the age of
            8, with the freedom to establish schools "without charges for the state".
            The system, however, remained the previous one: an elementary school lasting 5 years, 3 years of middle
            school and then the "professional Institute".
            Throughout the second half of the twentieth century various reforms followed one another, including that of
            1969 with which state nursery schools were established and the admission exam to the high school was
            abolished.
            Also in this year, regulations were approved which liberalized access to university studies and which
            modified the maturity exam with two written tests and one oral.
            During the seventies there remained the problems of school evasion, which manifested itself particularly
            through a phenomenon of selection through the rejection of pupils.
            A great novelty were the "delegated decrees", approved in '74, which introduced a representation of parents,
            ATA staff and student representatives.
            The major change, however, occurred in elementary school: the "full-time school" was born as a response to
            social needs and destined to become a laboratory of innovation for learning and for curricular space.
            In 1979 Latin was eliminated from the school curriculum.
            In the eighties and nineties, the problems of selective failures reappeared, but the biggest problem was
            "school dropout", or the lack of adequate levels of learning even in the absence of failures.
            An attempt was therefore made to increase the age of compulsory schooling, but without success. There were
            still significant changes in elementary school, such as the introduction of a plurality of teachers for the
            same class.
