        <p>
            This project was born from a school assignment that involved all the students.
            The project in question concerns the <a href="https://unric.org/it/agenda-2030/">Agenda 2030</a> in
            particular, goal 4.
            The quality; of education is; very important, as this irreversibly impacts students, their preparation, and
            their future life.
            For this reason, it is important that it be preserved for the good of our country and our future.

        </p>

        <h4 class="text-header">Perch√© abbiamo deciso queste nazioni?</h4>
        <p>
            First of all, the choice of Italy is quite obvious, as it is the country we live in, and which consequently, we know best.
            And Ethiopia?
            Ethiopia was an East African kingdom of ancient independence that years before the Second World War, was occupied by the Kingdom of Italy.
            After the war it returned to independence and after a period of dictatorship it returned to democracy.
            We made this choice because Ethiopia was influenced by Italy and we were curious about the difference between our school systems.
